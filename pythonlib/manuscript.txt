That is why today I'm working with our AI Mycroft to give this presentation
Understanding what I'm talking about and advancing to the proper slide artificial intelligence will drive the next decade of innovation
self driving cars predictive medicine and automated financial planning all of these technologies are near
and one of the key technologies driving our ai future is natural language processing
the ability of a computer to understand human language and respond via the most expressive form of human communication speech
natural language processing will change the way humans interact with machines
and there's a whole community of developers and innovators out there
proprietary and secretive not anymore
meet mycroft the worlds first open source artificial intelligence platform
mycroft allows users to speak to their technology naturally and receive a natural response
we started the mycroft project by developing a wireless speaker with a high quality microphone
to make the device relatable and set a positive tone we modeled it on wall e eva et and big hero six
we also wanted to encourage our community to hack
explore and extend the device so we based it on the raspberry pi and arduino
two popular prototyping technologies
but mycroft ai is not a device maker in fact we've opened our hardware schematics under an open source hardware license
mycroft is a software platform that allows developers to add natural language processing to anything
mycroft is open so developers can include it in anything from an automobile to a microwave
a mycroft enabled car lets you ask what is the tire pressure in the front right tire
our advantage is that any software developer
can download and install mycroft free of charge
supporting customers is going to take a great team and that is where mycroft shines
spring of two thousand fifteen we went to kickstarter to see if there was a market for our idea and closed the largest campaign ever to come out of Kansas
our success brought in talented developers like Sean Fitzgerald
we were invited to join tech stars
and began shipping developer kits april two thousand sixteen
that may we reached an agreement with Canonical ltd that will put Mycroft on more than fourty million devices
and in january we accepted a strategic investment from Jaguar Land Rover
we also joined five hundred startups
in may we moved on to the second round of the ai x prize
and accepted a spot in the prestigious mass challenge program
and im happy to annouce that we've been invited to join tech crunch disrupt this year as one of their ai and machine learning startups
using mycroft technology innovators and creators
artificial intelligence will be able to create products that communicate with users naturally in the same way i'm speaking to you
among these products will be a handful that will create value above and beyond what exists today
they will change the way people use technology in profound ways
many of you work in health care transportation communication or finance
ask yourself if your technology could understand human speech and respond naturally what would you build
