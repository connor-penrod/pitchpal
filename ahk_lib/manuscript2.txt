Today I'm here to talk to you about the technology that will drive the next decade of innovation. Artificial Intelligence. 1
Self driving cars, predictive medicine and automated financial planning - all of these technologies are near. 2
And one of the key technologies driving our AI future is natural language processing 3
The ability of a computer to understand human language and respond via the most expressive form of human communication - speech. 4
Natural language processing will change the way humans interact with machines. 5
And there's a whole community of developers and innovators out there who are seeking a platform that opens this technology and allows them to innovate 6
But so far its been the purview of a few large companies. Solutions like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Assistant have been walled off, proprietary and secretive. Not anymore. 7
Meet Mycroft 8
Mycroft allows users to speak to their technology naturally and recieve a natural response. 9
We started the Mycroft project by developing a wireless speaker with a high quality microphone. 10
To make the device relatable and set a positive tone we modeled it on Wall-E, Eva, ET and Big Hero 6. 11
We also wanted to encourage our community to hack 12
To explore and extend the device so we based it on Raspberry Pi and Arduino 13
Two popular prototyping technologies 14
But Mycroft AI, Inc. is not a device maker, in fact we've opened our hardware schematics under an open source hardware license and encouraged others to adopt our technology. 15
Mycroft is a software platform that allows developers to add natural language processing to anything. 16
And that is why Mycroft's opportunity is huge. Mycroft is open so developers can include it in anything from an automobile to a microwave. 17
Our advantage is that any software developer can download and install Mycroft free of charge. 18
This broadens the mouth of the sales funnel and reduces risk for our customers. 19
Supporting customers is going to take a great team and that is where Mycroft shines. 20
Spring of 2015 we went to kick starter to see if there was a market for our idea and raised $193,000 21
Our success brought in talented developers like Sean Fitzgerald 22
We were invited to join Techstars 23
And began shipping developer kits April 2016 24
That May we reached an agreement with Canonical Ltd that will put Mycroft on more than $40,000,000 devices in the next 12 months 25
We closed a $350,000 Angel Round in September 26
Won a $100,000 grant from Tech week 27
And in January we accepted a strategic investment from Jaguar Land Rover 28
and became the first Kansas company to join 500 Startups 29
In May, we moved on to the second round of the IBM Watson AIX Prize 30
and accepted a spot in the prestigious Mass Challenge program in Boston 31
And I'm happy to announce that on July 31, we'll close our $1,000,000 seed round 32
Using Mycroft's technology 33
innovators and creators in the field of artificial intelligence will be able to create products that communicate with users naturally in the same way that I am speaking to you 34
Among these products will be a handful that will create value above and beyond what exists today 35
so much so that not only will people be willing to pay for them 36
they will change the way people use technology in a profound way 37
Many of you work in healthcare, transportation, communication or finance. 38
Ask yourself if your technology could understand human speech and respond naturally, what woudl you build? 39
