Today I'm here to talk to you about the technology that will drive the next decade of innovation. Artificial
Intelligence. Self
driving cars, predictive medicine and automated financial planning - all of these technologies are near. And one of the key technologies driving our AI future is natural
language processing - the ability of a computer to understand human language and respond via the most expressive form of human communication -- speech
Natural language processing will change
the way humans interact with machines. From call centers to restaurants to elder care -- the ability to speak naturally with computers and recieve a natural response will fundamentally change the technology landscape. And there's a whole community
of developers and innovators out there who are seeking a platform that opens this technology and allows them to innovate, but so far it's been the purview of a few large companies. Solutions like Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google Assistant have been walled off, proprietary and secretive. Not
anymore. Meet Mycroft,
the world's first open source artifical intelligence platform. Mycroft is truly an AI for everyone. It is an artificial intelligence platform that brings natural language processing to the world of open source. That means the developers who are responsible for open technologies like Wikipedia, Wordpress and yes, Linux will finally have access to this groundbreaking technology. Mycroft is the open source community's answer to Siri and Amazon Echo.
