PITCHPAL.EXE(1)

NAME
    pitchpal.exe - starts a voice activated
                   presentation helper

SYNOPSIS
    pitchpal.exe mode [-n] [file] [recovery_level] [--debug | -d]

DESCRIPTION
    pitchpal.exe starts a session with a
    voice activated presentation helper. Given
    customized keywords, this program will
    switch slides when these keywords are said
    in order. Also, dictation mode can be activated
    to convert all speech to text in a command
    prompt.

OPTIONS
    mode - can be either "keyword" or "dictation"
           "keyword" starts keyword recognition mode
           and requires a specified txt file with each
           keyword on its own line.
           "dictation" starts speech to text conversion
           in the command prompt.

    [-n] - "dictation" mode only. Send converted speech-to-
           text as a Windows notification.

    [file] - "keyword" mode only. The keyword file to be used.

    [recovery_level] - "keyword" mode only. Specify how many
           future keywords can be said to have pitchpal.exe
           attempt to 'recover' the state of the
           presentation by going forward multiple slides.
           For example, if your keyword list is
           ["start", "presentation", "community"],
           a [recover_level] of 1 would cause the program
           to activate on "start" but also on "presentation".
           And if "presentation" was said then the program
           will go forward two slides to resynchronize itself.
           Default is 0.

    [--debug | -d] - starts pitchpal.exe in debug mode. Debug
                     messages will be displayed in "debug.txt"
                     in the executable's folder
